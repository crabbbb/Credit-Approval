```

# Model
1. Support Vector Classification (yixuan)
2. Random Forest Classification (fungqi)
3. Logistic Regression (xinjie)
4. K Nearest Neighbourhood (shanyi)
5. Xgboost Classification (janice)

# Step to Try your own model
1. Open New CreditApproval Process.ipynb file 
2. Run the Package installation step
3. Run Import Library step
4. Find a header called Test Model start from here, execute all the step below it
